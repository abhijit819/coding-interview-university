Algo:
	two pointers at start of each of the array
	compare the values of the pointers
	smaller value gets printed & the corresponding pointer is incremented

	After crossing one of array boundary
	print whichever array has elements left to print

	Time Complexity: m+n where m,n are sizes of the two arrays
	Space Complexity: constant
